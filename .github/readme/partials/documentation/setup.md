## 🦮 Setup

There are several ways to setup metrics, each having its advantages and disadvantages:

* [⚙️ Using GitHub Action on a profile repository *(~10 min)*](/.github/readme/partials/documentation/setup/action.md)
  * ✔️ All features
  * ✔️ High availability (no downtimes)
  * ➖ Configuration can be a bit time-consuming
* [💕 Using the shared instance *(~1 min)*](/.github/readme/partials/documentation/setup/shared.md)
  * ✔️ Easily configurable and previewable
  * ➖ Limited features *(compute-intensive features are disabled)*
* 🐳 Using command line with docker *(~5 min)* *(documentation not available yet)*
  * ✔️ Suited for one-time rendering
* [🏗️ Deploying your own web instance *(~20 min)*](/.github/readme/partials/documentation/setup/web.md)
  * ➖ Mostly intended for development, or to create another shared instance
