  ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
  Thanks for using metrics!

  Before asking a question or for help, try to:
    - Search for a similar already existing issue
    - Check README.md documentation
      - Note that most of documentation is collapsed by default, so be sure to open sections marked with "â–¶",
        the solution to your problem may already be present!

  For setup help...
    - Be sure to create required secrets (METRICS_TOKEN and other plugins token when needed)
    - Paste an excerpt of:
      - workflow step
      - error logs (if applicable)
      - direct GitHub links to the above
    - Optionally add screenshots or additional context

  For other questions...
    - Just write about what you want to talk!
