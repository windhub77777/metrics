### üéº Music plugin

The *music* plugin lets you display :

<table>
  <td align="center">
    <details open><summary>Random tracks from a playlist</summary>
      <img src="https://github.com/lowlighter/lowlighter/blob/master/metrics.plugin.music.playlist.svg">
    </details>

    </details>
    <img width="900" height="1" alt="">
  </td>
</table>

It can work in the following modes:

### Playlist mode

<details>
<summary>Apple Music</summary>

This mode is not supported for now.

I tried to find a way with *smart playlists*, *shortcuts* and other stuff but could not figure a workaround to do it without paying the $99 fee for the developer program.

So unfortunately this isn't available for now.

<details>
<summary>Spotify</summary>

Spotify does not have *personal tokens*, so it makes the process a bit longer because you're required to follow the [authorization workflow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)... Follow the instructions below for a  *TL;DR* to obtain a `refresh_token`.

Sign in to the [developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and create a new app.
Keep your `client_id` and `client_secret` and let this tab open for now.

![Add a redirect url](/.github/readme/imgs/plugin_music_recent_spotify_token_0.png)

Open the settings and add a new *Redirect url*. Normally it is used to setup callbacks for apps, but just put `https://localhost` instead (it is mandatory as per the [authorization guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/), even if not used).

Forge the authorization url with your `client_id` and the encoded `redirect_uri` you whitelisted, and access it from your browser:

```
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=********&response_type=code&scope=user-read-recently-played%20user-top-read&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost
```

When prompted, authorize your application.

![Authorize application](/.github/readme/imgs/plugin_music_recent_spotify_token_1.png)

Once redirected to `redirect_uri`, extract the generated authorization `code` from your url bar.

![Extract authorization code from url](/.github/readme/imgs/plugin_music_recent_spotify_token_2.png)

Go back to your developer dashboard tab, and open the web console of your browser to paste the following JavaScript code, with your own `client_id`, `client_secret`, authorization `code` and `redirect_uri`.

```js
(async () => {
  console.log(await (await fetch("https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token", {
    method:"POST",
    headers:{"Content-Type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
    body:new URLSearchParams({
      grant_type:"authorization_code",
      redirect_uri:"https://localhost",
      client_id:"********",
      client_secret:"********",
      code:"********",
    })
  })).json())
})()
```

It should return a JSON response with the following content:
```json
{
  "access_token":"********",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope":"user-read-recently-played user-top-read",
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "refresh_token":"********"
}
```

Register your `client_id`, `client_secret` and `refresh_token` in secrets to finish setup.

<details>
<summary>Last.fm</summary>

Obtain a Last.fm API key.

To do so, you can simply [create an API account](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) or [use an existing one](https://www.last.fm/api/accounts).

Register your API key to finish setup.

</details>

<details>
<summary>YouTube Music</summary>

Extract your YouTube Music cookies.

To do so, open [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com) (whilst logged in) on any modern browser

Open the developer tools (Ctrl-Shift-I) and select the ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù tab

![Open developer tools](/.github/readme/imgs/plugin_music_recent_youtube_cookie_1.png)

Find an authenticated POST request. The simplest way is to filter by /browse using the search bar of the developer tools. If you don‚Äôt see the request, try scrolling down a bit or clicking on the library button in the top bar.

Click on the Name of any matching request. In the ‚ÄúHeaders‚Äù tab, scroll to the ‚ÄúCookie‚Äù and copy this by right-clicking on it and selecting ‚ÄúCopy value‚Äù.

![Copy cookie value](/.github/readme/imgs/plugin_music_recent_youtube_cookie_2.png)
