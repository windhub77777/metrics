### 💡 Coding habits

The coding *habits* plugin display metrics based on your recent activity, such as active hours or languages recently used.

<table>
  <td align="center">
    <details open><summary>Recent activity charts</summary>
      <img src="https://github.com/lowlighter/lowlighter/blob/master/metrics.plugin.habits.charts.svg">
    </details>
    <details open><summary>Midly interesting facts</summary>
      <img src="https://github.com/lowlighter/lowlighter/blob/master/metrics.plugin.habits.facts.svg">
    </details>
    <img width="900" height="1" alt="">
  </td>
</table>

Using more events will improve accuracy of these metrics, although it'll increase the number of GitHub requests used.

Active hours and days are computed through your commit history, while indent style is deduced from your recent diffs.
Recent languages activity is also computed from your recent diffs, using [github/linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist).

Use a full `repo` scope token to access **private** events.

By default, dates use Greenwich meridian (GMT/UTC). Be sure to set your timezone (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for a list of supported timezones) for accurate metrics.

> 🔣 On web instances, *recent languages activity* is an extra feature and must be enabled globally in `settings.json`
