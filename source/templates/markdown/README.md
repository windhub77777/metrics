### üìí Markdown <sup>üöß v3.7</sup>

Markdown template can render a **markdown template** by interpreting **templating brackets** `{{` and `}}`.

<table>
  <td align="center">
    ‚ö†Ô∏è This feature is still under active developement and may not be functional yet
    <img width="900" height="1" alt="">
  </td>
</table>

It can be used to render custom markdown which include data gathered by metrics.
Unlike SVG templates, it is possible to include revelant hyperlinks since it'll be rendered as regular markdown.

You can even mix it with SVG plugins for even more customization.

See [example.md](/source/templates/markdown/example.md) for a markdown template example.

> Note that available data still depends on which plugins have been enabled.
> You may need to handle errors and setup plugins correctly in order to access to their output data.

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Examples workflows
