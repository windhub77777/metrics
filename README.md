## 🦑 Interested to get your own?

Try it now at [metrics.lecoq.io](https://metrics.lecoq.io/) with your GitHub username!

Because certain plugins require additional configuration and setup, some of them are not available at [metrics.lecoq.io](https://metrics.lecoq.io/).
For a fully-featured experience, consider using this as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-metrics-as-svg-image) instead!

# 📜 How to use?

## ⚙️ Using GitHub Action on your profile repository (~5 min setup)

Set up a GitHub Action which runs periodically and pushes your generated metrics image on your repository.
See all supported options in [action.yml](action.yml).

Assuming your username is `my-github-user`, you can then embed your metrics in your repository readme like below:

```markdown
![Metrics](https://github.com/my-github-user/my-github-user/blob/master/github-metrics.svg)
```

(or, for a new repository with a default branch of `main`):

```markdown
![Metrics](https://github.com/my-github-user/my-github-user/blob/main/github-metrics.svg)
```

<details>
<summary>💬 How to setup?</summary>

### 0. Prepare your personal repository

Create a repository with the same name as your GitHub username if it's not already done.

![Setup personal repository](.github/readme/imgs/setup_personal_repository.png)

Its `README.md` will be displayed on your user profile:

![GitHub Profile Example](.github/readme/imgs/example_github_profile.png)

### 1. Create a GitHub token

From the `Developer settings` of your account settings, select `Personal access tokens` to create a new token.

No additional scopes are needed, unless you want to include your private repositories metrics.

![Setup a GitHub personal token](.github/readme/imgs/setup_personal_token.png)

With a scope-less token, you can still display private contributions by enabling `Include private contributions on my profile` in your account settings:

![Enable "Include private contributions on my profile`"](.github/readme/imgs/setup_private_contributions.png)

Some plugins also require additional scopes, which is indicated in their respective documentation.
In case your token does not have the required scope (and `plugins_errors_fatal` is not enabled), it will be directly notified in the plugin render like below:

![Plugin error example](https://github.com/lowlighter/lowlighter/blob/master/metrics.plugin.error.svg)

### 2. Set your GitHub token in your personal repository secrets

Go to the `Settings` of your personal repository to create a new secret and paste your freshly generated GitHub token there.

![Setup a repository secret](.github/readme/imgs/setup_repository_secret.png)

### 3. Create a new GitHub Action workflow on your personal repository

Create a new workflow from the `Actions` tab of your personal repository and paste the following:

```yaml
name: Metrics
on:
  # Schedule updates
  schedule: [{cron: "0 * * * *"}]
  # Lines below let you run workflow manually and on each commit
  push: {branches: ["master", "main"]}
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  github-metrics:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # See action.yml for all options
      - uses: lowlighter/metrics@latest
        with:
          # Your GitHub token
          token: ${{ secrets.METRICS_TOKEN }}
          # GITHUB_TOKEN is a special auto-generated token restricted to current repository, which is used to push files in it
          committer_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

See all supported options in [action.yml](action.yml).

When using a token with additional permissions, it is advised to fork this repository to minimize security risks:
```yaml
      - uses: my-github-username/metrics@latest
```
In this case, consider watching new releases of this repository to stay up-to-date and enjoy latest features!

#### Preview vs release

It is possible to use `@master` instead of `@latest` to use new features before their official release.
Breaking changes may occur occasionally on `@master`, which could result in your metrics not being generated temporarily.

#### What will happen?

A new metrics image will be generated and committed to your repository on each run.

![Action update example](.github/readme/imgs/example_action_update.png)

#### Workflow examples

Check out this [workflow](https://github.com/lowlighter/lowlighter/blob/master/.github/workflows/metrics.yml) file which generates metrics daily.

Note that most of steps presented there are illustrative examples for this readme and are actually not needed to generate your own metrics.

### 4. Embed the link into your README.md

Edit your repository readme and add your metrics image:

```markdown
![Metrics](https://github.com/my-github-user/my-github-user/blob/master/github-metrics.svg)
```

</details>

## 💕 Using the shared instance (~1 min setup, but with limitations)

For convenience, you can use the shared instance available at [metrics.lecoq.io](https://metrics.lecoq.io) without any additional setup.

Assuming your username is `my-github-user`, you can embed your metrics in your repository readme like below:

```markdown
![Metrics](https://metrics.lecoq.io/my-github-user)
```

Visit [metrics.lecoq.io](https://metrics.lecoq.io) for more informations.

<details>
<summary>💬 Restrictions and fair use</summary>

Since GitHub API has rate limitations, the shared instance has a few limitations:
  * Images are cached for 1 hour
    * Your generated metrics won't be updated during this amount of time when queried
  * A rate limiter is enabled, although it won't affect already cached users metrics
  * Plugins which consume additional requests, or require additional token scopes are disabled

If you're appreciating this project, consider using it as a GitHub Action instead.

</details>

## 🏗️ Deploying your own web instance (~15 min setup, depending on your sysadmin knowledge)

It is possible to set up your own instance if you don't want to use GitHub Actions or if you want to allow others users on your instance.

When sharing an instance, it is advised to restrict the number of users which can use it through the rate limiter or the access list, to avoid reaching the requests limit of GitHub APIs.

See all supported options in [settings.example.json](settings.example.json).

<details>
<summary>💬 How to setup?</summary>

### 0. Prepare your server

You will need a server where you can set up and run a NodeJS application.

### 1. Create a GitHub token

From the `Developer settings` of your account settings, select `Personal access tokens` to create a new token.

No additional scopes are needed.

![Setup a GitHub personal token](.github/readme/imgs/setup_personal_token.png)

### 2. Install dependencies

Connect to server and ensure [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed (see tested version in [workflow](.github/workflows/workflow.yml#L18)).

Run the following commands to clone this repository, install dependencies and copy configuration example file:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics.git
cd metrics/
npm install --only=prod
cp settings.example.json settings.json
```

### 3. Configure your instance

Edit `settings.json` to configure your instance.

```javascript
{
  //See settings.example.json for all options
  //GitHub API token
    "token":"****************************************"
}
```

See all supported options in [settings.example.json](settings.example.json).

### 4. Start your instance

Run the following command to start your instance once you've finished configuring it:

```shell
npm start
```

From your browser, you should be able to access your web instance on the port you provided in `setting.json`.

### 5. Embed the link into your README.md

Edit your repository readme and add your metrics image from your server domain:

```markdown
![Metrics](https://my-personal-domain.com/my-github-user)
```

### 6. (optional) Setup as service on your instance

To ensure that your instance will restart if it reboots or crashes, you should set it up as a service.
This is described below for Linux-like systems which support *systemd*.

Create a new service file `/etc/systemd/system/github_metrics.service` and paste the following after editing paths inside:

```
[Unit]
Description=Metrics
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/metrics
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /path/to/metrics/index.mjs

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Reload services, enable it, start it and check if it is up and running:

```shell
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable github_metrics
systemctl start github_metrics
systemctl status github_metrics
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚠️ HTTP errors code</summary>

The following error codes may be encountered on a web instance:

| Error code                | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400 Bad request`         | Invalid query (e.g. unsupported template)                                  |
| `403 Forbidden`           | User not allowed in `restricted` users list                                |
| `404 Not found`           | GitHub API did not found the requested user                                |
| `429 Too many requests`   | Thrown when rate limiter is trigerred                                      |
| `500 Internal error`      | Server error while generating metrics images (check logs for more details) |
| `503 Service unavailable` | Maximum user capacity reached, only cached images can be accessed for now  |

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔗 HTTP parameters</summary>

Generated metrics images from a web instance can be configured through URL parameters.

#### Configuring base content

Base content is enabled by default, but passing `?base=0` will disable all base content.
You can choose to selectively enable or disable a specific `<section>` with `?base.<section>=<1|0>`.

For example, to opt out from `activity`, `community` and `metadata`, append `?base.activity=0&base.community=0&base.metadata=0` to your metrics url.

#### Configuring plugins

Plugins are disabled by default, but passing `?<plugin>=1` will enable a specific `<plugin>`.
Plugin options can be passed with `?<plugin>.<option>=<value>`.

For example, to enable `music` plugin and configure `music` plugin, you could append the following to your metrics url: `?music=1&music.provider=spotify&music.mode=recent&music.limit=4`.

Basically, most of [action.yml](action.yml) options can actually be used by web instance, with `plugin_` prefix dropped, and `.` instead of `_`.

</details>

# 📚 Documentation

## 🖼️ Templates

Templates allow you to change the general appearance of your metrics images.
Some metrics may be displayed differently, and all plugins may not be supported or behave the same from one template to another.

Consider trying them at [metrics.lecoq.io](https://metrics.lecoq.io)!

The default template is `classic`.

To use `repository` template, you'll need to provide a repository name in `query` option.

If the repository owner is different from the `token` owner, use the `user` option to specify it.

Add the following to your workflow:
```yaml
- uses: lowlighter/metrics@latest
  with:
    # ... other options
    template: repository
    user: "repository-owner"
    query: '{"repo":"repository-name"}'
```

## 🧩 Plugins

Plugins are features which can provide additional metrics and features.
In return, they may require additional configuration and consume additional API requests.

### 🗃️ Base content

Generated metrics contains a few sections that are enabled by default, such as recent activity, community stats and repositories stats.
This can be configured by explicitly opting out from them.

<details>
<summary>💬 About</summary>

By default, generated metrics contain the following sections:
* `header`, which usually contains your username, your two-week commits calendars and a few additional data
* `activity`, which contains your recent activity (commits, pull requests, issues, etc.)
* `community`, which contains your community stats (following, sponsors, organizations, etc.)
* `repositories`, which contains your repositories stats (license, forks, stars, etc.)
* `metadata`, which contains informations about generated metrics

You can explicitely opt out from them, which can be useful if you only want to keep a few sections or to use a plugin as standalone.

For example, to keep only `header` and `repositories` sections, add the following to your workflow:
```yaml
- uses: lowlighter/metrics@latest
  with:
    # ... other options
    base: "header, repositories" # opt-out from "activity", "community" and "metadata"
```

#### 🏦 Organizations memberships

By default, the `community` section only counts public organization memberships.
You can change your membership visibility in the `People` tab of your organization:

![Publish organization membership](.github/readme/imgs/setup_public_membership_org.png)

To include private organization memberships, you'll need to add the `read:org` scope to your personal token.

![Add read:org scope to personal token](.github/readme/imgs/setup_token_org_read_scope.png)

You may also need to [authorize your personal token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on) if you're using single sign-on and are encounting errors.

<details>
<summary>Apple Music</summary>

This mode is not supported for now.

I tried to find a way with *smart playlists*, *shortcuts* and other stuff but could not figure a workaround to do it without paying the $99 fee for the developer program.

So unfortunately this isn't available for now.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Spotify</summary>

Spotify does not have *personal tokens*, so it makes the process a bit longer because you're required to follow the [authorization workflow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)... Follow the instructions below for a  *TL;DR* to obtain a `refresh_token`.

Sign in to the [developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and create a new app.
Keep your `client_id` and `client_secret` and let this tab open for now.

![Add a redirect url](.github/readme/imgs/plugin_music_recent_spotify_token_0.png)

Open the settings and add a new *Redirect url*. Normally it is used to setup callbacks for apps, but just put `https://localhost` instead (it is mandatory as per the [authorization guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/), even if not used).

Forge the authorization url with your `client_id` and the encoded `redirect_uri` you whitelisted, and access it from your browser:

```
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=********&response_type=code&scope=user-read-recently-played&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost
```

When prompted, authorize your application.

![Authorize application](.github/readme/imgs/plugin_music_recent_spotify_token_1.png)

Once redirected to `redirect_uri`, extract the generated authorization `code` from your url bar.

![Extract authorization code from url](.github/readme/imgs/plugin_music_recent_spotify_token_2.png)

Go back to your developer dashboard tab, and open the web console of your browser to paste the following JavaScript code, with your own `client_id`, `client_secret`, authorization `code` and `redirect_uri`.

```js
(async () => {
  console.log(await (await fetch("https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token", {
    method:"POST",
    headers:{"Content-Type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
    body:new URLSearchParams({
      grant_type:"authorization_code",
      redirect_uri:"https://localhost",
      client_id:"********",
      client_secret:"********",
      code:"********",
    })
  })).json())
})()
```

It should return a JSON response with the following content:
```json
{
  "access_token":"********",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope":"user-read-recently-played",
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "refresh_token":"********"
}
```

With your `client_id`, `client_secret` and `refresh_token` you can finish the plugin setup by adding the following to your workflow:
```yaml
- uses: lowlighter/metrics@latest
  with:
    # ... other options
    plugin_music: yes
    plugin_music_provider: spotify
    plugin_music_token: "${{ secrets.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID }}, ${{ secrets.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET }}, ${{ secrets.SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN }}"
    plugin_music_mode: recent
    plugin_music_limit: 4
```

It will consume an additional GitHub request per event fetched.

Because of GitHub REST API limitation, provided token requires full `repo` scope to access **private** events.
Events that cannot be fetched will be ignored so it is still possible to use this plugin with a scope-less token.

A high value must be provided for `plugin_habits_from` in order for this section to be accurate, although it'll increase the number of GitHub requests sent.
If you're using GitHub Api in other projects, you could reach the rate limit.

![Habits plugin (facts)](https://github.com/lowlighter/lowlighter/blob/master/metrics.plugin.habits.facts.svg)

It is not mandatory to specify all partials, as the rest will automatically be appended in the default order.

#### 🔲 Adjust padding

The height of the generated metrics image is computed after being rendered through an headless browser.
As rendering can depends on used fonts and operating system, it may render as cropped or with additional blank space at the bottom.

It is possible to adjust the padding by adding the following to your workflow:
```yaml
- uses: lowlighter/metrics@latest
  with:
    # ... other options
    config_padding: 6%
```

Both positive and negative values are accepted, but you must specify a percentage.

If you specify a single value, it'll be used as for both width and height padding.
When two values are specified separated by a comma, the first one will be used for width and the second for height.

#### 🎋 Using a specific branch instead of default

Is is possible to commit generated metrics in a specific branch rather than default branch by adding the following to your workflow:
```yaml
- uses: lowlighter/metrics@latest
  with:
    # ... other options
    committer_branch: my-branch
```

#### 🍴 Including forked repositories

Is is possible to include forked repositories into generated metrics by adding the following to your workflow:
```yaml
- uses: lowlighter/metrics@latest
  with:
    # ... other options
    repositories_forks: yes
```

#### 💱 Convert output to PNG/JPEG

It is possible to convert output from SVG to PNG or JPEG images by adding the following to your workflow:
```yaml
- uses: lowlighter/metrics@latest
  with:
    # ... other options
    config_output: png
```

Note that `png` does not support animations while `jpeg` does not support both animations and transparency.
