## üìú How to use ?

### ‚öôÔ∏è Using GitHub Action on your profile repo (~5 min setup)

A GitHub Action which is run periodically at your convenience which generates and push an SVG image on your personal repository.

Assuming your username is `my-github-user`, you can embed your metrics in your personal repository's readme like below :
```markdown
![GitHub metrics](https://github.com/my-github-user/my-github-user/blob/master/github-metrics.svg)
```

Or with HTML :
```html
<img src="github-metrics.svg" alt="My GitHub metrics">
```

<summary>üí¨ How to setup ?</summary>

#### 0. Prepare your personal repository

If you don't know yet or haven't done it yet, create a repository with the same name as your GitHub username.

![Personal repository](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/blob/master/docs/imgs/personal_repo.png)

The `README.md` of this repository will be displayed on your GitHub user profile like below !

![GitHub Profile](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/blob/master/docs/imgs/github_profile.png)

#### 1. Create a GitHub token

In your account settings, go to `Developer settings` and select `Personal access tokens` to create a new token.

You'll need to create a token with the `public_repo` right so this GitHub Action has enough permissions to push the updated SVG metrics on your personal repository.

![Create a GitHub token](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/blob/master/docs/imgs/personal_token.png)

#### 2. Put your GitHub token in your personal repository secrets

Go to the `Settings` of your personal repository to create a new secret and paste your GitHub token here with the name `METRICS_TOKEN`.

![Setup secret](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/blob/master/docs/imgs/repo_secrets.png)

#### 3. Create a new GitHub Action workflow on your personal repo

Go to the `Actions` of your personal repository and create a new workflow.

Paste the following and don't forget to put your GitHub username.
```yaml
name: GitHub metrics as SVG image
on:
  # Update metrics each 15 minutes. Edit this if you want to increase/decrease frequency
  # Note that GitHub image cache (5-15 minutes) still apply so it is useless to set less than this, you're image won't be refreshed
  schedule: [{cron: "*/15 * * * *"}]
  # Add this if you want to force update each time you commit on master branch
  push: {branches: "master"}
jobs:
  github-metrics:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: lowlighter/metrics@latest
        # This line will prevent this GitHub action from running when it is updated by itself if you enabled trigger on master branch
        if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[Skip GitHub Action]')"
        with:

          # Your GitHub token ("public_repo" is required to allow this action to update the metrics SVG image)
          token: ${{ secrets.METRICS_TOKEN }}

          # Your GitHub user name
          user: my-github-user

          # Additional options
          # ==========================================

          # The GitHub token used to commit to your repository (defaults to the same value as "token")
          # This can be used to specify the token of a bot account if you use a personal token with advanced permissions
          # (which is needed if you want to include metrics of your private repositories, or to enable plugins like traffic)
          committer_token: ${{ secrets.METRICS_BOT_TOKEN }}

          # Path/filename to use to store generated SVG
          filename: github-metrics.svg

          # If you own a website and you added it to your GitHub profile,
          # You can provide a PageSpeed token to add your site's performance results on the metrics SVG image
          # See https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started to obtain a key
          plugin_pagespeed: no
          pagespeed_token: ${{ secrets.PAGESPEED_TOKEN }}

          # Enable repositories lines added/removed count
          plugin_lines: no

          # Enable repositories traffic (pages views) count
          # The provided GitHub token will require "repo" permissions
          plugin_traffic: no

          # Enable debug logs
          debug: no

```

On each run, a new SVG image will be generated and committed to your repository.

This could virtually increase your commits stats, so it is recommended to pass a bot account token to `token` instead.
The bot will be able to track metrics of all your public repositories.

If you want to also track your private repositories metrics, you'll need to pass a personal token with `repo` permissions to `token`, and use the `committer_token` parameter to pass the bot account token.

#### 4. Embed the link into your README.md

Edit your README.md on your repository and link it your image :

```markdown
![GitHub metrics](https://github.com/my-github-user/my-github-user/blob/master/github-metrics.svg)
```

</details>

### üíï Using the shared instance (~1 min setup, but with limitations)

For conveniency, you can use the shared instance available at [metrics.lecoq.io](https://metrics.lecoq.io).

Assuming your username is `my-github-user`, you can embed your metrics in your personal repository's readme like below :
```markdown
![GitHub metrics](https://metrics.lecoq.io/my-github-user)
```

<details>
<summary>üí¨ Restrictions and fair use</summary>

Since GitHub API has rate limitations and to avoid abuse, the shared instance has the following limitations :
  * Images are cached for 2 hours
    * Your generated metrics **won't** be updated during this amount of time
    * If you enable or disable plugins by changing the url parameters, you'll need to wait before changes are applied
  * You're limited to 3 requests per 2 hours
    * Restriction **does not** apply to already cached users metrics, including your own
  * Most of plugins are not available
    * PageSpeed plugin can be enabled by passing `?pagespeed=1`, but metrics generation can take up some time

You should consider deploying your own instance or use GitHub Action if you're planning using this service.

</details>

### üèóÔ∏è Deploying your own instance (~15 min setup, depending on your sysadmin knowledge)

Using your own instance is useful if you do not want to use GitHub Action or allow others users to use your instance.

A GitHub token is required to setup your instance, however since metrics images are not stored on your repositories you do not need to grant any additional permissions to your token, which reduce security issues.

You can restrict which users can generate metrics on your server and apply rate limiting (which is advised or else you'll hit the GitHub API rate limiter).

It is also easier to change `query.graphql`, `style.css` and `template.svg` if you want to gather additional stats, perform esthetical changes or edit the structure of the SVG image.

#### 0. Prepare your server

You'll need to have a server at your disposal where you can install and configure stuff.

#### 1. Create a GitHub token

In your account settings, go to `Developer settings` and select `Personal access tokens` to create a new token.

As explained above, you do not need to grant additional permissions to the token.

![Create a GitHub token](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/blob/master/docs/imgs/personal_token_alt.png)

#### 2. Install the dependancies

Connect to your server.

You'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (the latter version is better, for reference this was tested on v14.9.0).

Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics.git
```

Go inside project and install dependancies :
```shell
cd metrics/
npm install
```

Copy `settings.example.json` to `settings.json`
```shell
cp settings.example.json settings.json
```

#### 3. Configure your instance

Open and edit `settings.json` to configure your instance.

```javascript
{
  //Your GitHub API token
    "token":"****************************************",

  //The optionals parameters below allows you to avoid reaching the GitHub API rate limitation

    //A set of whitelisted users which can generate metrics on your instance
    //Leave empty or undefined to disable
    //Defaults to unrestricted
      "restricted":["my-github-user"],

    //Lifetime of each generated metrics
    //If an user's metrics are requested while lifetime is still up, a cached version will be served
    //Defaults to 60 minutes
      "cached":3600000,

    //Maximum simultaneous number of user which can be cached
    //When this limit is reached, new users will receive a 503 error
    //Defaults to 0 (unlimited)
      "maxusers":0,

    //Rate limiter
    //See https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit
    //Disabled by default
      "ratelimiter":{
        "windowMs":60000,
        "max":100
      },

  //Port on which your instance listen
  //Defaults to 3000
    "port":3000,

  //Debug mode
  //When enabled, "query.graphql", "style.css" and "template.svg" will be reloaded at each request
  //Cache will be disabled
  //This is intendend for easier development which allows to see your changes quickly
  //Defaults to false
    "debug":false,

  //Plugins configuration
  //Most of plugins are disabled by default
  //Enabling them can add additional informations and metrics about you, but increases response time
    "plugins":{
      //Pagespeed plugin
        "pagespeed":{
          //Enable or disable this plugin
          //When enabled, pass "?pagespeed=1" in url to generate website's performances
            "enabled":false,
          //Pagespeed token
          //See https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started to obtain a key
            "token":"****************************************"
        },
      //Lines plugin
        "lines":{
          //Enable or disable this plugin
          //When enabled, pass "?lines=1" in url to compute total lines added/removed in your repositories by you
            "enabled":true
        },
      //Traffic plugin
        "traffic":{
          //Enable or disable this plugin
          //When enabled, pass "?traffic=1" in url to compute total page views in your repositories in last two weeks
          //Note that this requires that the passed GitHub API token requires a push access
            "enabled":true
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4. Start your instance

Run the following command to start your instance :
```shell
npm start
```

Open your browser and test your instance :
```shell
http://localhost:3000/my-github-user
```

#### 5. Setup as service on your instance (optional)

You should consider using a service to run your instance.
It will allow to restart automatically on crash and on boot.

Create a new file in `/etc/systemd/system` :
```shell
vi /etc/systemd/system/github_metrics.service
```

Paste the following and edit it with the correct paths :
```
[Unit]
Description=GitHub metrics
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/metrics
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /path/to/metrics/index.mjs

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Reload services, enable it and start it :
```shell
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable github_metrics
systemctl start github_metrics
```

Check if your service is up and running :
```shell
systemctl status github_metrics
```

#### 6. Embed the link into your README.md

Edit your README.md on your repository and link it your image :

```markdown
![GitHub metrics](https://my-personal-domain.com/my-github-user)
```

## üìö Documentations

### üß© Plugins

Plugins are additional features that are disabled by default and which may requires additional configuration.

These can provide more informations into your generated metrics, but it could also make it longer to generate, which may not be suitable with a server instance if you're not using caching.

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Pagespeed

The *pagespeed* plugin allows you to add your website performances.

![Pagespeed plugin](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/blob/master/docs/imgs/plugin_pagespeed.png)

These are computed through [Google's pagespeed API](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started), which returns the same results as [web.dev](https://web.dev).

<details>
<summary>üí¨ About</summary>

To setup this plugin, you'll need an API key that you can generate in the [pagespeed API presentation](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started).

The website attached to your GitHub profile will be the one to be audited.
It will take about 10 to 15 seconds to generate the results, so it is advised to use this plugin alongside caching system or for automated image generation.

##### Setup with GitHub actions

Add the following to your workflow :

```yaml
- uses: lowlighter/metrics@latest
  with:
    # ... other options
    plugin_pagespeed: yes
    pagespeed_token: ${{ secrets.PAGESPEED_TOKEN }}
```

##### Setup in your own instance

Add the following to your `settings.json`

```json
  "plugins":{
    "pagespeed":{
      "enabled":true,
      "token":"****************************************"
    }
  }
```

And pass `?pagespeed=1` in url when generating metrics.

</details>

#### üë®‚Äçüíª Lines

The *lines* plugin allows you to add the number of lines of code you added and removed across your repositories.

![Lines plugin](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/blob/master/docs/imgs/plugin_lines.png)

<details>
<summary>üí¨ About</summary>

It will consume an additional GitHub request per repository.

##### Setup with GitHub actions

Add the following to your workflow :

```yaml
- uses: lowlighter/metrics@latest
  with:
    # ... other options
    plugin_lines: yes
```

##### Setup in your own instance

Add the following to your `settings.json`

```json
  "plugins":{
    "lines":{
      "enabled":true,
    }
  }
```

And pass `?lines=1` in url when generating metrics.

</details>

#### üßÆ Traffic

The *traffic* plugin allows you to add the number of pages views across your repositories.

![Traffic plugin](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/blob/master/docs/imgs/plugin_traffic.png)

<details>
<summary>üí¨ About</summary>

It will consume an additional GitHub request per repository.

Due to GitHub Rest API limitation, the GitHub token you provide will requires "repo" permissions instead of "public_repo" to allow this plugin accessing traffic informations.

![Token with repo permissions](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/blob/master/docs/imgs/token_repo_rights.png)

##### Setup with GitHub actions

Add the following to your workflow :

```yaml
- uses: lowlighter/metrics@latest
  with:
    # ... other options
    token: ${{ secrets.METRICS_TOKEN }} # Remember, this must have "repo" permissions for this plugin to work !
    plugin_traffic: yes
```

##### Setup in your own instance

Add the following to your `settings.json`

```json
  "plugins":{
    "traffic":{
      "enabled":true,
    }
  }
```

And pass `?traffic=1` in url when generating metrics.
